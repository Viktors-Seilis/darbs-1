        <h>Gas up your rig for the best CPU for gaming in 2019.</h>

        <p>The best CPU for gaming is the cornerstone for just about any suped-up gaming PC. Unlike actual economics, the power of your CPU tends to have a tangible, trickle-down effect on the performance of the rest of your components. You can dump truckloads of cash into the best graphics card for gaming, but without an appropriately beefy processor to push it to its limit, you're just going to end up bottlenecking your PC's performance. We get that a CPU isn't exactly the sexiest component to pick out for your high-end gaming PC build. But without the right CPU, your rig is going nowhere fast.</p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>Before buying a shiny new CPU, you'll need to check the compatibility of your motherboard, specifically you'll want to be looking at the socket and chipset. For the CPUs we've included on our list, you'll want to make sure you either have an Intel LGA1151 socket paired with a 300-series chipset. Alternatively, if you're looking at an AMD CPU, your motherboard will need an AM4 socket and a chipset of the 300, 400, or 500 series. While this isn't an issue with any of AMD's Ryzen processors, as they natively support overclocking, if you're planning to squeeze a little extra juice out of any of Intel's K-series processors, you'll need a motherboard that supports that feature as well. Namely, any board with a "Z" in front of the chipset number will suffice. </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>Another note on overclocking is to make sure you invest in one of the best CPU coolers to avoid any potential damage to this relatively sensitive component. This is more important if you're investing in any of the Intel K-series processors, as they don't include a stock cooler and a cheap solution will hardly suffice for the kind of thermal strain you're going to place on the CPU. AMD's stock coolers are okay for modest overclocking, generally speaking, but investing in a larger heatsink is always a solid practice to make sure you're not harming your CPU or inadvertently bottlenecking your rig.</p>
